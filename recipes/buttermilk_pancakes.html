        <p>It's really quite easy to make perfect buttermilk pancakes at home. You'll find the full, 
            step-by-step recipe below â€” but here's a brief overview of what to expect:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mix the dry ingredients:</strong>
                Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li><strong>Mix the wet ingredients:</strong>
                Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. 
                Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Make the pancakes:</strong>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and 
                mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. 
                Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. 
                Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown.</li>
        </ol>
